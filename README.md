    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Deployment

### 1.  Simple Deployment (For Testing/Development)

    This method is the quickest way to get the application running for basic testing.  It uses the Flask development server, which is **not recommended for production**.

    * **Run the Flask application:**

        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

    * **Access the application:**
        * Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`  (or the address shown in your terminal).
        * If deploying to a remote server, make sure your server's firewall allows traffic on port `5000`, and use  `http://<your_server_ip>:5000/`  in your browser.
